/*
 * Function declaration: The function keyword has a name.
 *
 * Parameters vs. Arguments
 * At first, it can be a bit tricky to know when something is either a parameter or an argument.
 * The key difference is in where they show up in the code:
 *  A parameter is always going to be a variable name and appears in the function declaration.
 * On the other hand, an argument is always going to be a value (i.e. any of the JavaScript data
 * types - a number, a string, a boolean, etc.) and will always appear in the code when the function
 * is called or invoked.

/*
 * Returning
 * If you don't explicitly define a return value, the function will return undefined by default.
